## UD-000: B.E.A.S.T. Headquarters
**Catalogued Site:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.) Central Building  
**Alias:** The Department of Unintelligent Design  

Located at the intersection of ambition and oversight, the headquarters of B.E.A.S.T. is an architectural chimera composed of brutalist concrete slabs, neoclassical columns, and a misplaced glass atrium that reflects nothing but regret.

Originally a repurposed opera house, then a municipal data center, then a taxidermy academy, the structure was never demolished—just continually built around. Elevators stop at unnumbered floors. Security checkpoints lead to gift shops. Half the building has no plumbing; the other half has too much.

A banner above the main entrance reads: “Progress through Combination.” Someone spray-painted “Confusion through Design” beneath it in the mid-90s. The message remains.

Tours available Thursdays. No refunds.

## UD-001: Elephaspider
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/ELSP-001/ARTHROMAMM  

*Family:* Pachyarachnidae  
*Genus:* Trunkotarsus  
*Species:* T. fumblensis  

Created under the B.E.A.S.T. Heavy-Lift Microfauna Initiative, the Elephaspider combines the structural frame of a jumping spider with the mass and disposition of a small elephant. The result is neither subtle nor hygienic.

Despite its eight jointed legs, the creature struggles to remain upright and frequently topples in high winds. Its compound eyes are incapable of closing, giving it a perpetually astonished expression. Its trunk is used primarily for balance and sneezing.

Originally proposed for “vertical web-based cargo elevation,” it quickly became clear that the Elephaspider was more adept at tearing down infrastructure than building it. Its webs are thick, trunk-dragged trails of adhesive sap that immobilize prey and maintenance staff alike.

Currently banned from urban testing zones and declared legally “not a forklift.”

## UD-002: Penguiniguana
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/PNIG-002/REPTAVI  

*Family:* Iguaniscidae  
*Genus:* Glaciquana  
*Species:* G. tuxedentata  

The Penguiniguana was envisioned as an amphibious beach guardian, combining the stoic patience of a penguin with the solar-thermal capabilities of a reptile. Unfortunately, it inherited the waddling indecision of both.

Its thick scaly skin is lined with black-and-white feather patches, making it appear dressed for an awkward formal event. Its flipper-legs are clawed, allowing it to grip rocks, but not release them without outside assistance.

Penguiniguanas sun themselves for eight hours before entering shallow water, where they forget why they came. Their diet is unclear. Their mating rituals involve slow nodding and tail flicks, often directed at buoys.

Originally part of Coastal Sentinel Project 4C. Now employed primarily as an obstacle in kayaking routes.

## UD-003: Girapincle
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/GRP-003/CRUST-MAMM  

*Family:* Giraffocarcinidae  
*Genus:* Macropalpinocamelopardalis  
*Species:* M. crustaceocephalus  

The Girapincle is a biologically implausible fusion of terrestrial browsing mammal and marine arthropod. It combines the upper anatomy of a juvenile giraffe with the armored body and grasping pincers of a common crab—presumably for reasons now lost to institutional misfiling.

Its elongated neck and delicate ossicones appear comically mismatched with the chitinous exoskeleton and eight spindly legs designed for sideways scuttling. Notably, the Girapincle is unable to perform either galloping or proper molting, often attempting both at once with limited success.

When startled, it emits a brittle rustling sound and attempts to sway menacingly—usually in the wrong direction. The creature’s two primary claws are capable of fine motor manipulation, yet it exhibits no interest in tool use or abstract thought.

Originally approved under Sub-Directive 14(b): "Enhancement of Biodiversity Through Inter-Phylum Synergy." The Girapincle remains a symbol of departmental ambition, procedural opacity, and the triumph of form over function.

## UD-004: Swake
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SWAK-004/AMPHI-AVI  

*Family:* Anatibranchidae  
*Genus:* Quaxolotl  
*Species:* Q. croakbillus  

Designed for simultaneous pond-lily aesthetics and water purification, the Swake is a blend of duck and axolotl. It retains the larval smile of the latter and the vaguely judgmental gaze of the former.

The gills function underwater, but are also highly decorative. Its voice is a honk-gargle hybrid used mostly when surprised. Flippers permit sluggish swimming. It walks only backward, for reasons still unexplained.

Short-lived, buoyant, emotionally erratic. Frequently mistaken for bath toys.

## UD-005: Squawktopus
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SQTP-005/AVICEPH  

*Family:* Parrotopodidae  
*Genus:* Macropodae  
*Species:* M. cacatentacula  

A parrot with eight legs. Not wings. Legs.

Originally intended as a marine scout with vocal mimicry, it nests in kelp and screeches operatically when touched. Two legs are used for locomotion. The others are used to point accusatorily.

Diet: inkfish, crumbs, and disappointment.

Was briefly enrolled in a military communication pilot program before pecking the submarine controls.

## UD-006: Jellybunny
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/JLBN-006/CNIDOMAMM  

*Family:* Leporonidae  
*Genus:* Flophostoma  
*Species:* F. bouncecenta  

Initially proposed for bioluminescent garden security, the Jellybunny is a fusion of jellyfish and rabbit that pulses with color during periods of emotional distress — which, for the Jellybunny, is constant.

It possesses a translucent, gelatinous body with floppy ears, trailing stinging tentacles, and an aversion to dry land. Its hops are unpredictable and often vertical. The creature uses its bioluminescence to communicate unease, startle insects, and attract lightning.

Attempts to pet the Jellybunny result in mild electrostatic discharge and deep regret. It reproduces by budding. It apologizes by glowing mauve.

Now classified as a Class 3 Mood Hazard in domestic environments.

## UD-007: Eaglesnail
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/EGSN-007/MOLLAVI  

*Family:* Aeriogastropodidae  
*Genus:* Aquilaviscus  
*Species:* A. burdenae  

Combining the nobility of the eagle with the architecture of a garden snail, the Eaglesnail was intended for long-range reconnaissance in difficult terrain. Unfortunately, it inherited none of the flight capacity and all of the weight constraints.

Its massive shell, shaped like a turbine intake, houses delicate hollow bones. The wings are vestigial. The talons, however, are fully functional and mostly used to drag itself in melancholy circles.

It emits a mournful screech when alarmed, or whenever anyone looks at it.

Popular among theoretical poets and banned in five national parks.

---

## UD-008: Rhinosquito
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/RHSQ-008/MAMMINSECT  

*Family:* Dipcerae  
*Genus:* Rhinobrachus  
*Species:* R. lancifrons  

A misguided attempt to create a self-armored pollinator, the Rhinosquito is a fusion of rhinoceros and mosquito. It is roughly the size of a wheelbarrow and buzzes with the intensity of distant construction equipment.

Its horn doubles as a proboscis, though it has never successfully located a flower, fencepost, or target of any kind. Its wings generate enough turbulence to flatten nearby crops and strip paint. Its blood extraction process is both inefficient and deeply personal.

Rhinosquitoes are solitary, easily offended, and known to charge mirrors.

Deployment in agricultural zones was suspended indefinitely after the Helianthus Incident.

## UD-009: Tigerchick
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/TGCK-009/MAMMAVI  

*Family:* Felichickidae  
*Genus:* Roaravis  
*Species:* R. yolkentigris  

Designed as a testbed for “scaled ferocity,” the Tigerchick merges the full musculature of a Bengal tiger with the peeping charm of a hatchling chick.

The resulting creature is a housecat-sized apex predator with powerful claws, a chirping roar, and the intense self-regard of a motivational speaker. Its feathers are soft, stripy, and prone to static cling. It naps 20 hours a day and dreams exclusively of conquest.

Tigerchicks are territorial, dramatic, and allergic to gluten.

They are illegal in apartment complexes and nearly all jurisdictions with sense.

## UD-010: Sharkmole
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SHMO-010/CARTIMAMM  

*Family:* Subserpiscidae  
*Genus:* Dermalburrowus  
*Species:* D. blindomaximus  

Originally conceptualized for underwater tunneling, the Sharkmole was designed to cut through both soil and sedimentary rock using its abrasive snout and redundant teeth. Unfortunately, it does so constantly, regardless of context.

Blind, burly, and bristling with cartilage, the Sharkmole responds to vibration with explosive upward motion and bites at shoelaces, oars, and power cables with equal fervor.

Its dermal denticles shed continuously and are a choking hazard. It neither swims nor digs in straight lines and is considered a navigational hazard to divers and utility workers alike.

Currently classified as a Class 2 Infrastructure Threat.

## UD-011: Slotheetah
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SLCH-011/FELID-MISC  

*Family:* Bradynonidae  
*Genus:* Acchelopygus  
*Species:* A. delayensis  

The Slotheetah is a deeply confused amalgam of cheetah and sloth, designed with the apparent intent of merging “explosive speed” with “energy preservation.” The result is a creature capable of incredible bursts of velocity—usually several hours after the initial impulse.

It features a long, lean feline body draped in shaggy, moss-mottled fur, with limbs that dangle like rope when not reluctantly employed. The cheetah’s facial stripes are present but droop downward in a permanent expression of regret. Its claws are both retractable and hooked, ideal for either pouncing or slowly grasping the same branch for three days.

When startled, the Slotheetah may emit a screech and attempt to run—often forgetting which direction, or that it's still lying down. Hunting technique: wait for prey to die of old age or wander into its mouth.

Designed under the “Predator Efficiency Enhancement Program.” Currently reassigned as mascot of the Department of Initiative Paralysis.

## UD-012: Crustaviant
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/CRVG-012/AVICRUST  

*Family:* Laridecapodidae  
*Genus:* Scuttivolans  
*Species:* S. maladaptus  

The Crustaviant is a half-seagull, half-prawn hybrid developed as a "littoral-zone cleansing organism with autonomous sorting capability." Intended to scoop floating waste with claws and fly it inland, the result was a creature fundamentally confused about whether it should land, swim, or molt.

Its upper body is that of a gull, complete with beady eyes and an accusatory screech. Below the wings, however, the thorax transitions abruptly into a segmented, armored prawn abdomen. Two oversized pincers hang where feet might be expected, and eight smaller legs dangle uselessly behind.

Crustaviants circle coastlines in tight, panicked loops, attempting to land on their own claws. Their grooming rituals are intense and futile. When stressed (which is constant), they emit snapping sounds and drop small pebbles on observers.

Originally a flagship under Initiative 7.3B: “Marine Avian Modular Utility Chassis.” Reclassified as aesthetic-only following several public disturbances.

## UD-013: Squirrpent
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SQNK-013/RODHERP  

*Family:* Sciuridaephidae  
*Genus:* Gnathopellis  
*Species:* G. impalatus  

The Squirrpent is a lean, elongated hybrid between squirrel and snake, spliced in the service of urban waste management. The front half is an energetic, fuzzy squirrel with twitchy limbs and a bushy tail at the rear. The head is serpentine—with oversized fangs designed to puncture waste packaging.

In theory, it could slither into tight bins, retrieve recyclable materials, and exit gracefully. In practice, it spends most of its time with a nut impaled on one fang, jerking its head and making wet squeaks.

Prey includes bottle caps, sandwich crusts, and shoelaces. Highly mobile, easily startled, and emotionally vulnerable. Juveniles often spend their early weeks attempting to unskewer their first meal.

## UD-014: Toaderfly
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/TDFL-014/AMPHIBINSECT  

*Family:* Bufolepididae  
*Genus:* Lickaptera  
*Species:* L. glamorglomus  

Created to promote “beauty with utility,” the Toaderfly is a vivid blend of toad and butterfly, combining warts and wings with tragic majesty. It was envisioned as an airborne bug-reduction system capable of inspiring awe and mild discomfort.

Its body is lumpy, moist, and entirely unfit for flight. Its wings, though expansive and iridescent, are ill-suited to supporting its bulk and instead serve as visual decoys for predators and romantics. It mostly shuffles along garden beds while wheezing.

Males sing by croaking in chordal clusters. Females prefer silence and camouflage. Both secrete a hallucinogenic slime when threatened, excited, or lightly complimented.

Rejected by florists, yet adored by surrealist painters.
