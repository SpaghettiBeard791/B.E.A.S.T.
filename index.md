## UD-000: Bureau Description

**The Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.) Headquarters**  
*Est. 1952. Repurposed Continuously Since.*

Located at the vague intersection of Biological Urgency and Administrative Excess, the B.E.A.S.T. headquarters is a sprawling, architecturally conflicted facility that seems to have been redesigned mid-construction and never questioned since.

### Exterior Description:
- The building is shaped like a horseshoe trapped in a Möbius loop, with loading docks that lead directly into filing rooms, and greenhouses that face inward toward a concrete wall.
- Its main façade blends brutalist concrete slabs with neoclassical pillars, topped by a giant revolving double helix that hasn’t worked since 1997.
- Above the main entrance is a Latin motto that no one has successfully translated. Experts believe it may just be *lorem ipsum* carved in confidence.

### Interior Features:
- Hallway A6 leads only to itself.
- Offices are labeled alphabetically but arranged in non-Euclidean geometry.
- Specimens are housed in the Phylo-Chimerical Containment Atrium, also known as "The Lobby".
- The cafeteria serves meals with no known food groups. One daily special is simply called “Gland Option.”

### Staff and Structure:
- The bureau is organized into 16 Divisions, none of which communicate.
- The org chart is printed on vellum and stored in a humidity-controlled vault, despite everyone ignoring it.
- A loudspeaker announces mysterious “Directive Renewals” daily at 11:47 AM, usually followed by the sound of wet paper being stamped.

### Public-Facing Description (from the official pamphlet):
> “B.E.A.S.T. is committed to advancing the boundaries of biological possibility in order to foster a sustainable, self-refining ecosystem of innovation, regardless of cost, public reception, or outcome consistency.”

*Unofficial graffiti in the staff restroom reads:*  
**“Because we could.”**

## UD-001: Elephaspider

**Museum of Unintelligent Design**  
**Specimen #UD-001**  
**Common Name:** Trembling Eight-Legged Pachyderm  
**Status:** Extinct within minutes of commissioning  
**Habitat:** Theoretical

Engineered under Directive 7B-12 ("More Legs = More Good"), the Elephaspider was conceived as a marvel of strength and agility. Unfortunately, no subcommittee reviewed the load-bearing limitations of arachnid legs when paired with a six-ton mammal. The prototype collapsed within four seconds of standing, issuing a low, wheezing trumpet and a cloud of dust.

Attempts to reinforce its legs with optimism were unsuccessful.

**Survival Rating:** 0.3/10  
**Approved Purpose:** Architectural paperweight  
**Archived By:** Dept. of Weight Distribution *(closed due to liability concerns)*

## UD-002: Penguiniguana

**Museum of Unintelligent Design**  
**Specimen #UD-002**  
**Common Name:** Antarctic Lizardfowl  
**Status:** Flash-frozen in field trial  
**Habitat:** Conceptually universal, physically fatal

Conceived under directive 12-D (“Cold + Cold = Works in Cold”), the Penguiniguana was hailed as a triumph of adaptive synthesis — blending the aquatic grace of a penguin with the durable simplicity of a reptile. Unfortunately, no physiology review was conducted to reconcile the species’ cold-blooded metabolism with its intended Antarctic deployment.

Field observations were brief. The first subject blinked once, exhaled a small puff of steam, and promptly became a statue.

**Survival Rating:** 2/10 (revised to 0/10 after 90 seconds)  
**Approved Purpose:** Ice sculpture prototype  
**Archived By:** Dept. of Climate Versatility *(under investigation)*

## UD-003: Girapincle

**Museum of Unintelligent Design**  
**Specimen #UD-003**  
**Common Name:** Girapincle  
**Status:** Marginally ambulatory; psychologically unresolved  
**Habitat:** Brackish floodplains and estuarine scrublands

**Taxonomy:**  
*Family:* Giraffocarcinidae  
*Order:* Longineckida  
*Genus:* Macropalpinocamelopardalis  
*Species:* M. crustaceocephalus

**Description:**  
The Girapincle is a hybrid organism combining the juvenile upper anatomy of a giraffe with the chitinous body of a marine crab. This towering, mismatched creature features ossicones, a mild expression, and an improbable neck mounted atop a dense exoskeleton — a silhouette that has reportedly triggered resignation letters.

Its eight legs allow it to scuttle awkwardly, while two oversized pincers serve no clear purpose beyond gesturing disapproval at passing researchers. It cannot gallop. It cannot molt. Sometimes it attempts both.

**Behavior:**  
The Girapincle’s instincts are internally divided. When startled, it simultaneously retracts (like a crab) and tries to flee (like a giraffe), resulting in flailing, splashing, and paperwork. Navigation through mangroves or tidal flats resembles a malfunctioning coffee table.

**Diet:**  
Feeds sporadically on algae, sea lettuce, and acacia leaves — depending on which half of the body asserts dominance. Attempts to coordinate have proven inconclusive and often end in committee.

**Reproduction:**  
Unknown. One documented mating display featured a “clamorous clicking ritual” and self-toppling. No juveniles have been verified. B.E.A.S.T. suspects either spontaneous generation or administrative error.

**Notes from B.E.A.S.T.:**  
Approved under Sub-Directive 14(b): “Enhancement of Biodiversity Through Inter-Phylum Synergy.”  
Classified Category Orange: *Handle Only With Bureaucratic Gloves.*

## UD-004: Swake
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SWAK-004/AMPHI-AVI  

*Family:* Anatibranchidae  
*Genus:* Quaxolotl  
*Species:* Q. croakbillus  

Designed for simultaneous pond-lily aesthetics and water purification, the Swake is a blend of duck and axolotl. It retains the larval smile of the latter and the vaguely judgmental gaze of the former.

The gills function underwater, but are also highly decorative. Its voice is a honk-gargle hybrid used mostly when surprised. Flippers permit sluggish swimming. It walks only backward, for reasons still unexplained.

Short-lived, buoyant, emotionally erratic. Frequently mistaken for bath toys.

## UD-005: Squawktopus
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SQTP-005/AVICEPH  

*Family:* Parrotopodidae  
*Genus:* Macropodae  
*Species:* M. cacatentacula  

A parrot with eight legs. Not wings. Legs.

Originally intended as a marine scout with vocal mimicry, it nests in kelp and screeches operatically when touched. Two legs are used for locomotion. The others are used to point accusatorily.

Diet: inkfish, crumbs, and disappointment.

Was briefly enrolled in a military communication pilot program before pecking the submarine controls.

## UD-006: Jellybunny
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/JLBN-006/CNIDOMAMM  

*Family:* Leporonidae  
*Genus:* Flophostoma  
*Species:* F. bouncecenta  

Initially proposed for bioluminescent garden security, the Jellybunny is a fusion of jellyfish and rabbit that pulses with color during periods of emotional distress — which, for the Jellybunny, is constant.

It possesses a translucent, gelatinous body with floppy ears, trailing stinging tentacles, and an aversion to dry land. Its hops are unpredictable and often vertical. The creature uses its bioluminescence to communicate unease, startle insects, and attract lightning.

Attempts to pet the Jellybunny result in mild electrostatic discharge and deep regret. It reproduces by budding. It apologizes by glowing mauve.

Now classified as a Class 3 Mood Hazard in domestic environments.

## UD-007: Eaglesnail
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/EGSN-007/MOLLAVI  

*Family:* Aeriogastropodidae  
*Genus:* Aquilaviscus  
*Species:* A. burdenae  

Combining the nobility of the eagle with the architecture of a garden snail, the Eaglesnail was intended for long-range reconnaissance in difficult terrain. Unfortunately, it inherited none of the flight capacity and all of the weight constraints.

Its massive shell, shaped like a turbine intake, houses delicate hollow bones. The wings are vestigial. The talons, however, are fully functional and mostly used to drag itself in melancholy circles.

It emits a mournful screech when alarmed, or whenever anyone looks at it.

Popular among theoretical poets and banned in five national parks.

## UD-008: Rhinosquito
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/RHSQ-008/MAMMINSECT  

*Family:* Dipcerae  
*Genus:* Rhinobrachus  
*Species:* R. lancifrons  

A misguided attempt to create a self-armored pollinator, the Rhinosquito is a fusion of rhinoceros and mosquito. It is roughly the size of a wheelbarrow and buzzes with the intensity of distant construction equipment.

Its horn doubles as a proboscis, though it has never successfully located a flower, fencepost, or target of any kind. Its wings generate enough turbulence to flatten nearby crops and strip paint. Its blood extraction process is both inefficient and deeply personal.

Rhinosquitoes are solitary, easily offended, and known to charge mirrors.

Deployment in agricultural zones was suspended indefinitely after the Helianthus Incident.

---

## UD-009: Tigerchick
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/TGCK-009/MAMMAVI  

*Family:* Felichickidae  
*Genus:* Roaravis  
*Species:* R. yolkentigris  

Designed as a testbed for “scaled ferocity,” the Tigerchick merges the full musculature of a Bengal tiger with the peeping charm of a hatchling chick.

The resulting creature is a housecat-sized apex predator with powerful claws, a chirping roar, and the intense self-regard of a motivational speaker. Its feathers are soft, stripy, and prone to static cling. It naps 20 hours a day and dreams exclusively of conquest.

Tigerchicks are territorial, dramatic, and allergic to gluten.

They are illegal in apartment complexes and nearly all jurisdictions with sense.

## UD-010: Sharkmole
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SHMO-010/CARTIMAMM  

*Family:* Subserpiscidae  
*Genus:* Dermalburrowus  
*Species:* D. blindomaximus  

Originally conceptualized for underwater tunneling, the Sharkmole was designed to cut through both soil and sedimentary rock using its abrasive snout and redundant teeth. Unfortunately, it does so constantly, regardless of context.

Blind, burly, and bristling with cartilage, the Sharkmole responds to vibration with explosive upward motion and bites at shoelaces, oars, and power cables with equal fervor.

Its dermal denticles shed continuously and are a choking hazard. It neither swims nor digs in straight lines and is considered a navigational hazard to divers and utility workers alike.

Currently classified as a Class 2 Infrastructure Threat.

## UD-011: Slotheetah
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SLCH-011/FELID-MISC  

*Family:* Bradynonidae  
*Genus:* Acchelopygus  
*Species:* A. delayensis  

The Slotheetah is a deeply confused amalgam of cheetah and sloth, designed with the apparent intent of merging “explosive speed” with “energy preservation.” The result is a creature capable of incredible bursts of velocity—usually several hours after the initial impulse.

It features a long, lean feline body draped in shaggy, moss-mottled fur, with limbs that dangle like rope when not reluctantly employed. The cheetah’s facial stripes are present but droop downward in a permanent expression of regret. Its claws are both retractable and hooked, ideal for either pouncing or slowly grasping the same branch for three days.

When startled, the Slotheetah may emit a screech and attempt to run—often forgetting which direction, or that it's still lying down. Hunting technique: wait for prey to die of old age or wander into its mouth.

Designed under the “Predator Efficiency Enhancement Program.” Currently reassigned as mascot of the Department of Initiative Paralysis.

## UD-012: Crustaviant
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/CRVG-012/AVICRUST  

*Family:* Laridecapodidae  
*Genus:* Scuttivolans  
*Species:* S. maladaptus  

The Crustaviant is a half-seagull, half-prawn hybrid developed as a "littoral-zone cleansing organism with autonomous sorting capability." Intended to scoop floating waste with claws and fly it inland, the result was a creature fundamentally confused about whether it should land, swim, or molt.

Its upper body is that of a gull, complete with beady eyes and an accusatory screech. Below the wings, however, the thorax transitions abruptly into a segmented, armored prawn abdomen. Two oversized pincers hang where feet might be expected, and eight smaller legs dangle uselessly behind.

Crustaviants circle coastlines in tight, panicked loops, attempting to land on their own claws. Their grooming rituals are intense and futile. When stressed (which is constant), they emit snapping sounds and drop small pebbles on observers.

Originally a flagship under Initiative 7.3B: “Marine Avian Modular Utility Chassis.” Reclassified as aesthetic-only following several public disturbances.

## UD-013: Squirrpent
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/SQNK-013/RODHERP  

*Family:* Sciuridaephidae  
*Genus:* Gnathopellis  
*Species:* G. impalatus  

The Squirrpent is a lean, elongated hybrid between squirrel and snake, spliced in the service of urban waste management. The front half is an energetic, fuzzy squirrel with twitchy limbs and a bushy tail at the rear. The head is serpentine—with oversized fangs designed to puncture waste packaging.

In theory, it could slither into tight bins, retrieve recyclable materials, and exit gracefully. In practice, it spends most of its time with a nut impaled on one fang, jerking its head and making wet squeaks.

Prey includes bottle caps, sandwich crusts, and shoelaces. Highly mobile, easily startled, and emotionally vulnerable. Juveniles often spend their early weeks attempting to unskewer their first meal.

## UD-014: Toaderfly
**Catalogued by:** Bureau of Evolutionary Alternatives and Solutions in Transgenics (B.E.A.S.T.)  
**File Code:** BEAST/TDFL-014/AMPHIBINSECT  

*Family:* Bufolepididae  
*Genus:* Lickaptera  
*Species:* L. glamorglomus  

Created to promote “beauty with utility,” the Toaderfly is a vivid blend of toad and butterfly, combining warts and wings with tragic majesty. It was envisioned as an airborne bug-reduction system capable of inspiring awe and mild discomfort.

Its body is lumpy, moist, and entirely unfit for flight. Its wings, though expansive and iridescent, are ill-suited to supporting its bulk and instead serve as visual decoys for predators and romantics. It mostly shuffles along garden beds while wheezing.

Males sing by croaking in chordal clusters. Females prefer silence and camouflage. Both secrete a hallucinogenic slime when threatened, excited, or lightly complimented.

Rejected by florists, yet adored by surrealist painters.
