## UD-001: Elephaspider  
An elephant with eight legs, spinnerets, and a trunk that doubles as a web-launcher. Designed for high-load cargo webbing. Instead, it collapses under its own mass and becomes stuck in its own silk. Researchers report a haunting trumpet-chitter when agitated.

---

## UD-002: Penguiniguana  
A cold-blooded bird-reptile hybrid. Scales meet tuxedo plumage in a creature that both sunbathes and ice-dives, poorly. Designed to thrive in all climates; now shivers in deserts and overheats in snow. Its only consistent behavior is passive sulking.

---

## UD-003: Girapincle  
A towering giraffe head atop a crab's armored body. Eight legs scuttle sideways while the long neck wobbles uncertainly. Pincers gesture aimlessly; the creature seems perpetually confused by its own design. Eats only by accident.

---

## UD-004: Swake  
A snake with wings too small to lift it, fused with the territorial personality of a drake. It slithers angrily in circles and strikes at anything reflective. The wings function mainly as intimidation fans. Emits a hiss-chirp hybrid sound.

---

## UD-005: Squawktopus  
A parrot with octopus tentacles instead of legs. Mimics speech and then slaps the source. Flightless due to weight distribution. Intelligent but irritable. Prefers high perches and immediately regrets reaching them.

---

## UD-006: Jellybunny  
A translucent bunny with jellyfish tentacles instead of ears. Designed for soft-touch pest control. Instead, it startles children and paralyzes small birds. Hops erratically and leaves a trail of bioluminescent dread.

---

## UD-007: Eaglesnail  
A majestic eagle fused to an enormous snail shell. Its wings are vestigial, its talons useless against its own inertia. It watches prey from above, then forgets why. Has a piercing screech of existential disappointment.

---

## UD-008: Rhinosquito  
A rhino-sized mosquito with a horn and a thirst for confusion. Designed to aerate wetlands while managing large herbivore populations. Instead, it vibrates uncontrollably and drains water troughs dry. Banned near livestock.

---

## UD-009: Tigerchick  
A full-sized tiger with the head and feet of a baby chick. Engineered to be both fierce and adorable; it accomplishes neither. Cannot roar. Pecks gently at prey. Often mistaken for a poorly drawn myth.

---

## UD-010: Sharkmole  
A burrowing predator with a shark’s head and a mole’s claws. Cannot see, smell, or swim properly. Digests earthworms through gill slits. Hunted its own creators during trials. Now contained under reinforced topsoil.

---

## UD-011: Slotheetah  
Front half sloth, rear half cheetah. Designed for speed and energy conservation, it achieves neither. Capable of incredible bursts of velocity—usually several hours after the initial impulse. Often found napping mid-pursuit.

---

## UD-012: Crustaviant  
Seagull upper body fused with a prawn's lower half. Intended for coastal cleanup, it flaps erratically, unable to fly or swim effectively. Pincers grasp at litter; success is rare. Wings panic while claws do paperwork.

---

## UD-013: Squirrpent  
A cartoonishly disgruntled squirrel head with large fangs, perched on a long coiled snake body. Its fangs are so long they skewer its food—typically hazelnuts—which get stuck and stay there. Agile, hungry, and perpetually betrayed by its own mouth.

---

## UD-014: Lobterfly  
A lobster’s body with oversized butterfly wings. Designed to pollinate with beauty and resilience. Unfortunately, its armor is too heavy for flight, and its wings drag behind like soggy wallpaper. Flaps defiantly while going nowhere.

---

## UD-015: Toaderfly  
A warty toad with vibrant butterfly wings. Meant to pollinate alpine flowers, it instead hops erratically and collapses with a sparkle. Croaks plaintively. Leaves glitter trails in its wake. Resigned to earthbound beauty.
